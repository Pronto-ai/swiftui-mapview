# Contributing to SwiftUI MapView

You're welcome to contribute improvements and fixes to the project.
Thank you for your time investment!

Please read the following guide to ensure consistency and a shared level of quality for your contribution.
The goal is to have everything ready so that the process is as straight forward as possible for everyone.
If there are instructions missing, feel free to contribute changes to this guide as well.

**Before you start contributing** please make sure of the following:

1. Ensure that you have a clear goal in mind. Proposing or implementing changes should not divert from the project's goal.
2. When unsure of whether your changes meet the project's goal open an issue to discuss your intentions and its consequences.

**When opening issues or pull requests** please make sure of the following:

1. Describe the specific goal of the issue or pull request. Focus on one topic so that it can be worked on in isolation.
2. Add your thoughts and questions to the description so that issues can be addressed quickly.
3. Highlight important sections in code that need attention and are critical to understanding the changes.
4. Avoid mixing multiple changes or ideas in one contribution. Each one should be one logical unit (i.e. do not mix new features with fixes to existing ones).

Once you feel comfortable with these guidelines feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/sgade/swiftui-mapview/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/sgade/swiftui-mapview/pulls) on GitHub.
